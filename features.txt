To enhance this project with the Capstone feature and additional improvements, here’s a pseudocode plan that integrates key functionalities while keeping it flexible for expansion. The goal is to provide real-time feedback on the juggler’s performance and display metrics, including an "optimization score" that dynamically evaluates juggling quality.

Pseudocode: Enhanced Juggling Tracker with Optimization Metrics
Core Modules
Initialize System and Load Configuration

Load video stream (or video file).
Set up object detection parameters (color threshold, mask parameters).
Initialize tracking parameters (number of balls, tracking sensitivity).
Initialize UI overlay elements (score display, tracking dots).
Main Video Processing Loop

For each frame in the video:
Preprocess Frame:

Resize frame for faster processing.
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Convert frame to HSV color space for robust color detection.
Generate Object Mask:

Create binary mask based on color range for ball detection.
Apply morphological operations (erode and dilate) to clean up the mask.
Detect Objects in Mask:

Find contours (white regions in mask) to identify balls.
For each detected contour:
Calculate centroid of each ball using contour moments.
Track each ball’s position using centroid coordinates.
Object Tracking and Pattern Analysis

Update Centroid Tracker:

Register new centroids or update positions of existing tracked balls.
Handle disappearing balls (e.g., drops) by adjusting disappearance threshold.
Maintain historical positions for each tracked ball.
Calculate Pattern Metrics:

Determine Juggling Optimization Score:
Measure symmetry, consistency, and spacing between ball trajectories.
Evaluate each throw's height, dwell time, and throw angle.
Calculate an optimization score as a percentage:
100% = optimal symmetry, even height and spacing, and minimal drift.
<100% = decreases based on deviations in height, drift, drops, or collisions.
Display Real-Time Metrics

Overlay Real-Time Information on Frame:
Display optimization score as a percentage in the upper-right corner.
Display count of successful catches and drops.
Draw trajectories and centroids for each ball.
Optionally: Include a visual indicator (e.g., green-to-red bar) showing the stability of the juggling pattern.
Post-Processing and Analysis

Save Processed Video with Overlays:
Combine the tracked video with real-time metrics overlay and save it as a new file.
Generate Detailed Report (optional):
For each juggling session, output a summary report with metrics:
Average optimization score
Total catches and drops
Symmetry and consistency statistics (e.g., left/right balance)
Graph of optimization score over time (to show performance trends).
Helper Functions and Modules
Calculate Optimization Score:

Input: Centroid positions, dwell times, throw heights, pattern symmetry.
Output: A percentage score representing juggling optimization quality.
Method:
Evaluate symmetry by comparing left and right hand metrics.
Determine throw consistency by calculating standard deviation in throw heights.
Check for extraneous movements (foot/shoulder/head movements).
Score decreases for each deviation (height, distance, asymmetry, and drop).
Render Overlay on Video:

Input: Current frame, score, tracked points, optional messages.
Output: Frame with overlay.
Method:
Draw a text box with the optimization score.
Display counts for successful catches and drops.
Draw ball trajectories and annotate centroids.
Track Catches and Drops:

Input: Current and previous positions of tracked balls.
Output: Updated count of catches and drops.
Method:
Track upward and downward movement transitions for each ball.
Increase drop count if a ball disappears for a certain number of frames.
Capstone Feature Implementation Notes
To implement the "optimization score," consider calculating values based on:

Symmetry: Compare left and right hand patterns to ensure balance.
Height Consistency: Check that each throw achieves a similar height.
Spacing Consistency: Ensure even spacing between balls to minimize collisions.
Stability of Trajectories: Minimal drift of ball paths from the desired arcs.
Finally, integrate this pseudocode plan into the existing codebase as modular functions and refine each module based on testing feedback. This will allow the system to generate insightful, real-time feedback on juggling quality.
